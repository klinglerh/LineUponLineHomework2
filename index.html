            <span class="line"></span>
            <p>We started line upon line in 2008, in part, because working with composers on new work was/is our favorite thing to do as a musicians. In fact, working with composers and getting to know them as people is very likely why we’re still in music at all. Line Upon Line was created out of the desire to spend meaningful time with composers, grow community, and try to help pieces be the best they can be.</p>
